Flipkart Automation Project
The primary goal of this small project is to automate testing processes on the Flipkart e-commerce platform, allowing for efficient and reliable validation of the website's features and functionalities. I implemented a modular approach in my automation framework for the Flipkart website. Different classes were created to segregate tasks, such as locating web elements in one class and defining operations in others. This modular structure facilitated Data-Driven Testing, allowing for the separation of concerns and easier maintenance.
